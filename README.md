# Band Name Generator

A simple Python command-line application developed as part of **Day 1** of the  
**100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

This project introduces fundamental Python concepts through a small, interactive program that generates a band name based on user input.

# Project Overview

The Band Name Generator combines two user-provided inputs to suggest a potential band name:
- The name of the city where the user grew up
- The name of a pet (or any chosen word)

This project is designed to practice core programming concepts in a clear and practical way.

# Key Concepts Practiced
- Variables
- User input (`input()`)
- String concatenation
- Output formatting (`print()`)

# Example Usage

What’s the name of the city you grew up in?
Barcelona
What’s your pet’s name?
Luna

Your band name could be Barcelona Luna

# Technologies
- Python 3

# Learning Context
This project is part of my structured learning journey in Python and software development, following **Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code Bootcamp**.  
Each project in this repository represents a step in building strong programming fundamentals.
